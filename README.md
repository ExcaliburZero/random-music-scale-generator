How to use:

The program is fairly simple. To create a list of the scales the program can choose from, edit "My_Scales.txt" and add or remove scales untill you have all the scales that you want. Note that this program currently does not differentiate between major and minor scales. Enter the scales as the capital letter of the scale and for sharps use this format "F#" which uses a number sign, and for flats use this format "Bb" which uses a lower-case b.
